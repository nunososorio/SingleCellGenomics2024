# scRNA-seq data "challenges"

This folder contains data and instructions for additional exercises the students can do during the course.

## 1. Synthetic data

The first  exercises/challenges use a randomly generated dataset: [Toy_Data.h5ad](Toy_Data.h5ad). This a small scRNA-seq dataset (5887x126) produced using ad-hoc functions from the [Random_data_generation](Random_data_generation.ipynb) notebook. 

The [Challenge_toy_example](Challenge_toy_example.ipynb) notebook contains some possible multiple choice questions abouot this dataset that can be given to the students, together with the (likely) answers.
